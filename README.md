# Assignment:
The task is to design and implement a backend service to control the
temperature in the building(s). The API should be REST based and the state of
the building should be persisted to any form of persistent storage. There is no
need for any frontend but we expect there to be a README.md file with build
directions and examples of how to invoke the REST API (e.g. curl).
The project should be implemented using Java. Feel free to use any 3rd party
library that you are comfortable with. Unit tests are expected and the
assignment will be assessed based on good programming practices and
design.
